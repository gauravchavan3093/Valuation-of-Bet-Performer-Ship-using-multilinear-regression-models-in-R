[Both] the commercial and the academic values usually converge to the purchase price that a rational, well-informed investor (buyer) would pay for the acquisition of the vessel.\n\n\n**Key Questions to Think About the Next 4 Weeks**\n1. How much is the Bet Performer worth based on comparable transactions? Which ship is the best reference transaction?\n2. Can you think of other factors that may affect ship prices?\n3. What is the relationship between ship price and each ship feature in Exhibit 4?  What is the economic logic for why each feature might affect ship price?\n4. Which single feature is the best predictor of ship price?\n5. How well do all three ship features jointly explain ship prices?\n6. What would the price be if the ship was 5 years younger? 20K Deadweight Tons lighter? Or if charter rates were 30% lower?\n7. If you were Basil Karatzas, what would you recommend to your client regarding an offer price for the Bet Performer?\n8. What other concerns or recommendations do you have?",
